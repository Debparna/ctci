/*
 The Graph
 There is a list of nodes and then every node has its own list of vertces/edges.
 
 When you create the graph, you specify the total number of nodes the graph is going to have. Every node has its own list.
 When you call the function add_edge it grabs the node (which is a list) at the index v. 
 Then it adds the number w to that list signifying there is a link from node v to node w. 
 The same happens again in the next statement except in reverse. 
 It grabs the list at index w and adds the number v to the list signifying there is a link from node w to node v.
 
 It is due to this nature we find the comment // Note: the graph is undirected, because it draws a path from both nodes to the other.


//Results in 5 lists that look like this

 (NODE) |  1, 2, 3
 adj[0] |
 ---------------------------------
 (NODE) |  0, 2
 adj[1] |
 ---------------------------------
 (NODE) |
 adj[2] |  0, 1
 ---------------------------------
 (NODE) |  0, 4
 adj[3] |
 ---------------------------------
 (NODE) |   3
 adj[4] |

 0 > 1, 2, 3
 1 > 0, 2
 2 > 0, 1
 3 > 0, 4
 4 > 3

/*
 BFS: Breadth First Search - Queue
 - Uses the idea of exhausting all the adjacent of a particular vertex before moving on to another vertex.
 - Runtime for BFS on GRAPHS - Since the sum of the lengths of all the adjacency lists is Î˜(E), the total time spent in scanning adjacency lists is O( E). The overhead for initialization is O( V), and thus the total running time of BFS is O( V + E)."
 
 ALGORITHM:
 - go to a vertex
 - Stay on vertex and go to an adjacent vertex p
 - put that adjacent vertex on queue
 - Go back to original vertex and go to next adjacent vertex
 - Put that vertex on queue again
 - Keep doing that till all there vertices get over
 - After we are done with the first vertex, go to the next one by popping the first one 	off the queue
 - That first vertex on queue is the next chosen vertex and do the same thing again, go
 its adjacent vertices and keep adding to the queue the vertices that have not already
 been visited
