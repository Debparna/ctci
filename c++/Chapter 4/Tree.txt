Traversals:
Preorder:  N L R
Postorder: L R N
Inorder: L N R

BFS: Queue
   - go to a vertex
   - Stay on vertex and go to an adjacent vertex p
   - put that adjacent vertex on queue
   - Go back to original vertex and go to next adjacent vertex
   - Put that vertex on queue again
   - Keep doing that till all there vertices get over
   - After we are done with the first vertex, go to the next one by popping the first one 	off the queue
   - That first vertex on queue is the next chosen vertex and do the same thing again, go 
     its adjacent vertices and keep adding to the queue the vertices that have not already
     been visited

DFS: Stack
	- Go to a vertex, mark it as visited and push on to stack
	- Choose an adjacent vertex to visit, mark it as visited and push onto stack
	- Go to that adjacent vertex and choose a vertex of the adjacent vertex
	- Go to that vertex, mark that as visited and push onto stack
	- then go to the vertex of the adjacent vertex and do the same
	- Go all the way in the depth and keep doing that till once for a vertex there are 
	  no more vertices left unvisited
	- When a vertex has no more unvisited vertices then pop it off the stack
	- keep popping till you find a vertex with a adjacent vertex, then mark that one 	  as visited and put that into stack.
