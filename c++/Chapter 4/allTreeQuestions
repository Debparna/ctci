 QUESTION 1 - Balance a binary tree
Implement a function to check if a tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is de ned to be a tree such that no two leaf nodes di er in distance from the root by more than one.
The idea is very simple: the di erence of min depth and max depth should not exceed 1, since the di erence of the min and the max depth is the maximum distance di erence pos- sible in the tree. */

 QUESTION 3
Given a binary search tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth (eg, if you have a tree with depth D, you’ll have D linked lists).
In a usual breath  first search traversal, we simply traverse the nodes without caring which level we are on. In this case, it is critical to know the level. We thus use a dummy node to indicate when we have  nished one level and are starting on the next.

 RESULT:
 5
 2 7
 1 3 6 8
 4 9


Use the same createBST function as above to create the tree
Use a vector of linked lists to store the linked lists at each depth.

QUESTION 3
Write an algorithm to find the ‘next’ node (e.g., in-order successor) of a given node in a binary search tree where each node has a link to its parent.
 Questions:
 1) Is the link to parent direct or indirect?
 2) Is the given node any node or will it always be the root node?
 3) What does next mean? Right below? lesser or greater?
 Main goal: 
 - Find the next node of a given node.
 - BST
 - each node has a link to its parent
 
 My Algorithm:
 Since the successor according to the question is the next in its inorder traveral then see where the node is in its visitation order of the three positions - left, parent or right. If
 
Solution:
Inorder: L N R
We approach this problem by thinking very, very carefully about what happens on an in-order traversal. On an in-order traversal, we visit X.left, then X, then X.right.
So, if we want to  find X.successor(), we do the following:
1. If X has a right child, then the successor must be on the right side of X (because of the order in which we visit nodes). Specifically, the left-most child must be the  first node visited in that subtree.
2. Else, we go to X’s parent (call it P).
2.a. If X was a left child (P.left = X), then P is the successor of X
2.b. If X was a right child (P.right = X), then we have fully visited P, so we call successor(P).

QUESTION 4
Design an algorithm and write code to find the first common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree. Avoid storing additional nodes in a data structure. NOTE: This is not necessarily a binary search tree.

 Questiond to ask: whats are you given?
 if the two nodes are given then

Solution -
For any node r, we know the following:
1. If p is on one side and q is on the other, r is the first common ancestor.
2. Else, the  first common ancestor is on the left or the right side.
 So, we can create a simple recursive algorithm called search that calls search(left side) and search(right side) looking at how many nodes (p or q) are placed from the left side and from the right side of the current node. If there are two nodes on one of the sides, then we have to check if the child node on this side is p or q (because in this case the current node is the common ancestor). If the child node is neither p nor q, we should continue to search further (starting from the child).
   If one of the searched nodes (p or q) is located on the right side of the current node, then the other node is located on the other side. Thus the current node is the common ancestor.
 
 Algorithm: NOT A BINARY TREE
Search left and right for p and q. If p and q are on two sides left and right of the root then the root is the common ancestor. If both of them are found on one side for example on the left or the right then increase curr parent from the root t go the the child on the side on which p and q were found. The from that new parent search which side p and q are, if they are on either side of the new parent then that parent is the common ancestor, otherwise do this again, increase the current parent to the next one on either side and search from there.

/*QUESTION 5
You have two very large binary trees: T1, with millions of nodes, and T2, with hundreds of nodes. Create an algorithm to decide if T2 is a subtree of T1.
Alternative Approach: 
The treeMatch procedure visits each node in the small tree at most once and is called no more than once per node of the large tree. Worst case runtime is at most O(n * m), where n and m are the sizes of trees T1 and T2, respectively. If k is the number of occurrences of T2’s root in T1, the worst case runtime can be characterized as O(n + k * m).
 
 Algorithm:
 T1 - Large tree
 T2 - Smaller tree
 For each node in T2 check if there is a matching node in T1.

/*QUESTION 6
You are given a binary tree in which each node contains a value. Design an algorithm to print all paths which sum up to that value. Note that it can be any path in the tree - it does not have to start at the root.

 
 Start from the root and branch left and right, computing the sum thus far on each path. When we  nd the sum, we print the current path. Note that we don’t stop just because we found the sum. Why? Because we could have the following path (assume we are lookingforthesum5):2+3+–4+3+1+2. Ifwestoppedoncewehit2+3,we’dmiss severalpaths(2+3+-4+3+1and3+-4+3+1+2). So,wekeepgoingalongevery possible path. On every node, we look “up” to see if we’ve found the sum. That is—rather than asking “does this node start a path with the sum?,” we ask “does this node complete a path with the sum?”
 
 Main Point: 
  - Print paths which sum up to a value.
  - Does not start at root
 
 My Algorithm: Start at a node, traverse the tree to find values lower than it and add each time a value is found. The minute the added value exceeds the given node value subtract the last value from it and add the next value that is lower than the given value. If there is no other value left then the paths of the nodes do not add up to the node. If the sum is reached, print the path.
   Questions to ask: if the path/nodes are already visited then are they invalid for the next round? 
                     if they are not invlaid then from where can we start and how many nodes can we repeat?
 
 Given Algorithm Interpreted:
 Check if root is null, if not assign it to the first level (level 0), sumPath is the path of nodes that will either equal or not equal the sum. Then loop to all the nodes in that level and add it to sumPath, for each added node check "lookup" to see if the sumPath matches the desired sum. If not go to the previous level (i = level, i--) and add the previous node to sumPath, then see if the sumPath with the two nodes added matches the sum(7), if it does, print it using the inner for loop. If it doesnt match i will reach below 0 which means no more levels left. The for loop will end and go to check if the root has a left, the recursive print call for root->left will do the same with root->left as the root(2), if the left is over then the root->right will start.
